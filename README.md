# cellSegmentation-Analysis

This is a cell segmentation and analysis code written in Matlab for obtaining Delta F/F
from a TIF stack of fluorescent images. Running runAll.m will run the scripts in order
to pre-process, segment cells, analyze and plot the resulting estimated DeltaF/F on a
per cell, per frame basis.
